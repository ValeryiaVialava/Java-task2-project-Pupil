#### **TASK**

Using the **Pupil** and **Main** classes:

1. Create a custom exception **`WrongGradeException`**, which will be thrown when attempting to add a grade outside the range of 1â€“6.
2. Handle this exception in such a way that it does not terminate the program but instead allows the user to re-enter the grade.
3. Implement appropriate mechanisms (conditional statements or exception handling) for the following scenarios:
    - The student has **0 grades**: what happens if we try to display the average?
    - The student has **1 grade**: what happens if we try to display a second grade?
    - The user enters a **letter instead of a grade**.
    - The user enters a **letter in a method that displays the grade**.
    - Are these all possible exceptions?

4. Using the `finally` block, add a fragment so that after each menu operation, a message is displayed on the screen, e.g.,
   `****************END 1************************`
